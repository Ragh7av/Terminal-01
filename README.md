A compact clock and timer with a surprise of gaming abilities for when its needed, with a custom 3d printed case and a minimalistic theme. </p>


        
<h1 align="center">Overview</h1>

        
<p align="center">This project is a custom retro tabletop built around the esp32 c3 supermini. It includes a vibrant 1.8-inch TFT LCD display, Type-C charging module with inbuilt protection, a rotary encoder module with push button as well, a speaker, some jumper cables and a battery ofc. 


<h1 align="center">Why am I even building this?</h1>
<p align="center">
 
 I built this project as a part of an event called [Fallout](https://fallout.hackclub.com), organized by an non-profit organization called [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com), we build and ship hardware projetcs and for that we get some cool gifts and grants to build it irl. After building hardware projects for 60 hours, we get invited to Shenzen, China on a Hardware Hackathon, I am building this project to work toward those 60 hours.
 
 </p>

<h1 align="center">Why Terminal-01?</h1>

So I spend a lot of time on my desk and frequently use a dekstop [Pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) app to help me navigate my work/study sessions, I also use a physical clock for seeing time ofc and have nothing really to do in my breaks which wont distract me too much.
I created this project  (which is also my first hardware project) for solving all these problems and  help myself getting [supercalifragilisticexpialidocious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious) in building super cool hardware things. 

<h1 align="center">The Features</h1>
</div>

1. Real-Time Clock: Displays an automatically synchronizing NTP time feed maintained by background Wi-Fi checks, featuring a persistent on-screen icon.

2. System Alarm: Offers an adjustable interface for setting daily alarms, triggering full-screen flashing visuals and audio sirens when activated.

3. Productivity Timer: Includes a Pomodoro focus timer that alerts users with an aggressive flashing visual and buzzer when a work session completes.

4. Gaming Console: Features a playable "Space Attack" arcade game with programmatic retro sound effects and dynamic boundary collision.

5. Screensaver: Displays a bouncing DVD logo that allows for real-time kinetic speed adjustment using the rotary encoder wheel.

# How to Build it?

**To replicate , follow the below mentioned steps:**
1) First, go grab the CAD from the CAD folder..or you can download the files from [here](https://github.com/Ragh7av/Terminal-01/tree/main/CAD/CAD%20files). I prefer going to the CAD folder and go through the CAD.md for detailed understanding of the CAD.
2) Then grab the parts mentioned in the [BOM](https://github.com/Ragh7av/Terminal-01/blob/main/BOM/BOM.csv)..
3) Wire up the electronics as per the [Circuit Diagram](https://github.com/Ragh7av/Terminal-01/blob/main/Wiring-diagram/Wiring%20diagram%20for%20Terminal-01%20%20%20(1).png).
4) Then upload the code from [here](https://github.com/Ragh7av/Terminal-01/blob/main/Firmware/Firmware.ino) in your ESP.
5) Check if everything is working properly.If yes then proceed to next step or check previous steps again.
6) Then assemble everything in the 3D shell as per the completely assemble .step file of the CAD

*Hurrahh!!You replicated Terminal-01*


  ## Firmware setup
  - Replace "Your_wifi" and "pass" with your personal network details (keep the quotation marks).
  - Set Your Local Time Zone by finding the time offset line in the code which looks like-
   '''const long gmtOffset_sec = 19800;'''
  If you are in India (IST), leave it at 19800 (5.5 hours × 3600 seconds).
  If you are in a different time zone, multiply your GMT/UTC offset hours by 3600 and enter that value.
   - Upload to Board: Connect your ESP32-C3 SuperMini via a USB-C cable, select the correct Port under Tools > Port, and click the Upload arrow button.
